# Brownian Motion Theme for Emacs

## What is this?

A light taupe and dark brown Emacs theme for the discerning user who thinks:

> "Why yes, I *do* want my text editor to look like an antique bookshop filtered through the aesthetic regret of 1970s wallpaper."

## Features

- Taupe background of unspeakable warmth.
- Dark brown text for those who fear commitment.
- Reddy-brown bold text for dramatic inner monologues.
- Org-mode headers styled like a sepia-toned fever dream.
- A modeline so tastefully understated it actively judges you.

## Installation

1. Clone this disasterpiece:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prc-tech/emacs-brownian-motion-theme.git ~/.emacs.d/themes/brownian-motion-theme/

Add this to your init.el:

(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/")
(load-theme 'brownian-motion t)



Profit. Or at least, drift tastefully through the chaos.
